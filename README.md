# ChatGPT Code Conversations

This repository is a quiet archive of coding-related conversations with ChatGPT.  
From bug fixes to architectural discussions, these threads reflect real-time thought processes, nudges, and learning moments.

🧠 **Why?**  
Sometimes it’s not just about the final solution — it's about how you got there.  
This is my way of keeping a personal log of those helpful detours and discoveries.
