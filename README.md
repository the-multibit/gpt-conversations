# ChatGPT · Code Archive

A personal log of technical conversations with ChatGPT — covering architecture decisions, edge-case debugging, performance tuning, and the occasional code rabbit hole.

This repo is a running archive of dev questions I’ve asked, problems I’ve solved (or partially solved), and paths I’ve explored with AI as a coding assistant.

## 📂 Structure

- Organized by topic or framework (e.g. `swiftui-layout`, `coredata`, `firebase-push`)
- Each `.md` file is a full thread:
  - ✅ Problem context
  - 🔍 Exploration process
  - 🛠️ Suggested implementations
  - 🧠 Notes or follow-ups (if any)

## 🧠 Why This Exists

I treat ChatGPT like a **pair programmer who never sleeps**.  
Not everything here is perfect — but it's honest. It documents:
- Dead ends I learned from
- Subtle fixes that saved hours
- Alternative approaches worth revisiting

> These are not tutorials.  
> This is technical journaling — with an LLM in the loop.
